Lift-overs is a food donation web application designed for business such as grocery stores and resturants to donate to organizations like food kitchens and NPOs. Drivers can donate their time to transport the food once the donation has been scheduled.

The frontend is generated using Handlebars, and bootstrap. MySQL was used for the database with Sequelize as the ORM.
